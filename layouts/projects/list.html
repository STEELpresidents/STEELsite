    As a new organization, we’re excited to launch our first official projects soon!  
    In the meantime, here’s a showcase of a past project our leadership team worked on that reflects the kind of work STEEL will be doing.

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
          This project was completed by STEEL’s founding leadership before the organization officially began.  
          It demonstrates the technical skills, teamwork, and innovation we aim to bring into all future projects at STEEL.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg">
          MARV was designed to provide supplies and relief to locations ambulances can't reach, such as the immediate aftermath of a natural disaster.
